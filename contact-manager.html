            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Contact Manager is a web-based application that provides users with a comprehensive solution for managing their personal and professional contacts. Built using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), this project demonstrates proficiency in traditional web development technologies and server-side programming.</p>
            
            <p>The application begins with a secure user registration and authentication system, allowing each user to maintain their own private contact database. Once logged in, users are presented with an organized table view of all their contacts, making it easy to browse and locate specific individuals.</p>

            <p>The platform offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, enabling users to add new contacts with detailed information, edit existing contact details, search through their contact list with advanced filtering options, and remove contacts they no longer need. The search functionality includes case sensitivity options and pagination support to efficiently handle large datasets.</p>

            <p>Special attention was paid to server performance optimization, ensuring the application remains stable and responsive even when managing extensive contact lists. The implementation demonstrates best practices in database design, query optimization, and secure user data handling.</p>
