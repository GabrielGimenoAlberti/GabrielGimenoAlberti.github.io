            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Event Organizer is a comprehensive full-stack web and mobile event management platform designed specifically for the UCF community. The application allows users to discover, create, and manage events in their area through an intuitive interface.</p>
            
            <p>The platform features two distinct user roles: organizers and regular users. Organizers have the ability to create events that are displayed publicly on an interactive map as well as in a list view format. Regular users can browse these events, search for specific activities, and RSVP to events they're interested in attending. Organizers maintain full control over their events with edit and delete capabilities, while users can easily view all events they've committed to attending.</p>

            <p>The application was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the web platform, with a mobile component developed using Flutter to ensure cross-platform accessibility. The project implements secure user authentication, RESTful API integration, and efficient database management to deliver a responsive and fully functional event management solution.</p>
